 Atops custom archinstall script to make life easy when installing arch. Warning!! This script was intended for me to use, not you. Of course you can try it if you want.

# (STILL IN PROGRESS.)

 ```curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atops93/archinstall/main/install.sh -o install.sh && sh install.sh```

### (SHORTER TYPING METHOD) 
```curl -LO https://atops.dev/install.sh && sh install.sh```
